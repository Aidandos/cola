# COLA: Consistent Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness
Accompanying repository for COLA: Consistent Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness

We provide one Google Colab notebook, in which you can run COLA and other general-sum learning algorithms on a set of zero- and general-sum games.
The notebook also provides code to plot the learning behavior, loss, and gradient fields.

Please raise issues if you encounter any problems!
